            Hi, I'm Hrithvik! I'm a software engineering student at the University of 
            Waterloo looking for 2023 full-time quant opportunities.
            <br /><br />
            In Summer 2019, I worked at <a href="https://www.talkaitive.com/company" target="_blank">Hiwave</a>,
            where i created image classification models and high-traffic data pipelines for 
            <a href="https://talkaitive.com" target="_blank">talk-AI-tive</a>, their flagship product.
            <br /><br />

            Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.lcbonext.com/" target="_blank">LCBO|Next</a>, 
            the innovation lab for LCBO, as a full-stack developer where I got to 
            be a part of the creation and deployment of many applications such as 
            <a href="https://crown.lcbonext.ca/" target="_blank">Crown</a> and <a href="https://inline.lcbonext.ca/welcome" target="_blank">
                Inline</a>.
            <br /><br />

            Currently, I work at <a href="https://capitalmarkets.bmo.com/en/" target="_blank">BMO Capital Markets</a> as a 
            Quantitative Analyst, where I hope to gain the unique 
            experience of doing software development tailored to the financial markets using Python and C#.  
            <br /><br />
